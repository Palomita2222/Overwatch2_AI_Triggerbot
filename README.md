# Overwatch2_AI_Triggerbot
This is an automatic triggerbot that uses a CNN model to detect robots in the screen ( only in the training camp ) and then triggers the shoot button when you are aiming at one. Also, Use soldier 76, as it was used for training.
No need to train or add training data to the model!!! The model has already been pre-trained, so just open the program after installing the modules, and have fun.
REMEMBER TO ONLY USE THIS IN THE TRAINING CAMP, AND THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, YOU WILL GET BANNED IF YOU USE THIS MALICIOUSLY
